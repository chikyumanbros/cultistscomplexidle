# Cultist's Complex.idle Game Manual

## Introduction
Greetings, aspiring cultist! Welcome to Cultist's Complex.idle, where you'll embark on a dark journey to summon eldritch abominations and sow madness across the land. This tome shall be your guide as you establish your cult, gain power, and work your way up the pantheon of cosmic horrors. 

## Getting Started
Upon beginning your journey, you'll want to familiarize yourself with the basic incantations and gestures to control your cult:

- Perform the "Collect Source" ritual by depressing your ritual focus to gather unholy Source energy
- Navigate between the planes of existence using the runic symbols at the top of the dark grimoire interface 
- Expand and contract the abomination invocation cards using the sacrificial arrows to show or hide their profane details
- Inscribe your progress in the holy texts or summon it forth using the sigil buttons at the top-right

The various planes and portals of the occult interface include:
- The Source and Miasma infernal gauges at the top, measuring your gathered power
- The Initiate plane on the left, with details on your loyal Followers and dark tidings 
- The central summoning portal, where you'll invoke and bind horrific Monsters
- The right wing altar with its Upgrades to augment your unholy abilities
- The Madness Table at the bottom for sowing insanity amongst the unenlightened masses

## Rituals of Power
The core cyclical rituals to grow your power are:

1. Gather Source through manual or automated rituals
2. Initiate Followers into the cult using Source
3. Sacrifice Followers to summon fell Monsters 
4. Harness your Monsters to generate more Source and accursed Miasma
5. Spread Miasma to drive pitiful adventurers to Madness
6. Mad adventurers further swell your Ranks with new Followers

As you perform these rituals, your power shall grow:

1. Begin with the Source gathering ritual
2. Initiate enough Followers to generate Source automatically 
3. Save up Source to summon your first cosmic horror
4. Create synergies between different varieties of Monster
5. Accumulate Miasma to spread insanity amongst adventurers
6. Acquire potent Upgrades to augment all your unholy abilities

## Resources
Your cult shall deal in two primary forms of power:

### Source
- The root of your power, used for all dark incantations
- Collected through manual Source gathering at first
- Later generated automatically by Initiates and Monsters
- Required to obtain Upgrades to your abilities

### Miasma
- A blight upon the land produced by your boundMonstrosities
- Builds up as Monsters fester
- Used to power the Madness spreading rituals 
- Cannot be manually harvested, only generated over time

## The Initiates
Your loyal Initiates are the foundation of the cult:

### Indoctrination
- The Source cost to corrupt new Initiates rises with each soul 
- Initiates constantly gather Source for your dark works
- Required sacrifices for summoning and binding Monsters
- Their efficiency can be improved through Upgrades

### Mechanics of the Indoctrinated
- Base Source gathering rate: 0.1 accursed units per second
- Indoctrination affected by various sinister multipliers
- Number of Initiates affects Monster synergy boons
